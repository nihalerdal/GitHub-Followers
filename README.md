# GitHub-Followers

## Overview
My version of the GitHubFollowers App was inspired by Sean Allen's take home project course. It allows you to see the follower list of a specific Github user. You can search for a specific follower within these followers and tap on a follower to reach user profiles. Also you can save your favorite username searches so you don't have to type them every time.
